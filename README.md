# Cyclocomputer

The project consists in the creation of a cyclocomputer that measures with the help of a magnetic field sensor the speed of a bicycle, the average speed and the total distance.

By using a button, the size of the bicycle wheel is selected. Another button cycles between the two operating modes: standard and sprint. In standard mode, the current speed, average speed and distance traveled are displayed on the screen. The sprint mode works similarly, but when the travel speed drops below a certain point, a led lights up, warning the user to increase the speed.

Components:

Arduino Nano

LCD Display 1602 IIC/I2C

Magnetic Sensor(Hall)

Buttons, 7mm, 2 pins

Led 5mm

Resistor 1kOhm
